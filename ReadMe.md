# Example projects for godot-rust

_**[Website]** | **[Main repo]** |  [Book] | [API Docs] | [Sponsor]_

This repository collects official examples for the **[gdext][Main repo]** library. There are few examples at the moment, and we don't
intend to showcase every aspect of the library here. Instead, examples are designed to be more "real-world" oriented, while
keeping in mind a small scope that is approachable.

Examples do not replace the book and API docs, but are meant to be read in addition. If you're encountering concepts in the
code that seem strange, please check both book and docs first!


## Current examples

We currently feature the following example projects:

- [**Dodge the Creeps**](examples/dodge-the-creeps)  
  A simple game where you dodge enemies. Ported from the official Godot tutorial.

- [**Hot reload**](examples/hot-reload)  
  Showcases how classes and their state can be hot-reloaded in the Godot editor.


## Contributions

If you would like to contribute an example, please open an issue **before** submitting a big pull request.
Keep in mind that this repo is not a collection of user projects, but an educational resource to complement
the book and API docs of the library. Therefore, examples need to follow certain standards regarding code quality,
documentation and maintainability. But don't worry, if you open an issue, we can guide you through! ðŸ™‚

Like the library, all contributions are subject to the [Mozilla Public License 2.0][mpl].
